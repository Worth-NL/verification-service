# Email (and phone?) Verification service

This repository is the beginning of a simple email and telephone number verification service to be used by public institutions in the Netherlands. We will be aiming to deliver a proof of concept of this codebase in september 2025. After that we will be making some important decisions on how to morph/move/discard this code in favor of something else.

If someone is running this code in production - please dont.

Please contact [Frank Molenaar](mailto:fmolenaar@worth.systems) for any inquiries surrounding the status of this component.
For more information or current developments you can also join the Common Ground Slack Channel: #verificatie-service
